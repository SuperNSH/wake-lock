# nsh-wake-lock

Keep the screen or the machine awake while the app needs it, and release it reliably.

Part of the Native Shell (NSH) capability set. Same layout as the other SuperNSH repos: a Rust crate, docs in `docs/`, CI on GitHub Actions, and a web status page on GitHub Pages at https://supernsh.github.io/wake-lock/.

## Status

**Scaffold. Not implemented.** The crate exposes one placeholder function and one test. Nothing here talks to a device yet. Read [docs/brief.md](docs/brief.md) for the planned approach and [docs/parity.md](docs/parity.md) for what is done.

## Planned approach

keepawake on desktop. Native idle-timer and window flags on mobile. Acquire a guard and release it on drop.

## Layout

- `src/lib.rs`: placeholder crate.
- `docs/brief.md`: options, recommended path and edge cases from the research.
- `docs/decisions.md`: open decisions.
- `docs/parity.md`: feature status.
- `site/`: static status page, published by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- `.zcode/workflow.ts`: the phases this area will run through.

## Checks

Every compile and test runs in GitHub Actions. Nothing is built on a developer machine.

## Licence

MIT. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
